Dash Plotly notes:

Dashh app have three main pilars to work:

1. Dash components:
    Slider, checkbox, day picker, dropdown, etc. 
    Dash components dive in two: Dash core components and Dash HTML components.

2. Plotly graphs:
    Graphs charts, etc.
    Mapbox, scatter plot, line chart, bar chart, etc.

3. The callback:
    It connects the Dash components and the Plotly graphs to create an interactive capability.


The Dash components and the Plotly graphs go inside the app layout, while the callback goes outside.

4. Right bellow the app callback, a function needs to be added with an arbitrary name and it will be linked to that call back function. 
The number inputs in the callback will be the number of varibales passed to the function. The number of elements returned from the fucntion will be the number 
number of outputs of the callback. 

5. Filter data frame with common pandas techniques. Note that is good practice to create a copy of the Dataframe inside of the function to avoid modifying 
the data in the original dataframe. dff = df.copy()

6. Plotly express is to create the graph once the data fram was filtered. 

7. Important note, if there's just one output in the app.callback, do not output it in a list (remove the bracktes). 

Notes:

There are two types of graphs, Plotly Exrpess (px) and Plotly Graph Objects (go). Plotly express is newer and easier.
